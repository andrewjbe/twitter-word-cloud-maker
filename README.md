# twitter-word-cloud-maker
A shiny app that creates word clouds and provides a list of most used words from a given twitter account.

Deployed version: https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/word-cloud-maker/

In order to make this work yourself, you'll have to include a valid Twitter API token, which you can get using Rtweet. It'll need to be
in the form of a .rds file named '.rtweet_token1.rds' located in the same file as the .Rmd file. The '.Renviron' file in this repo tells R where to find your API key.
